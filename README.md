# The Sparks Foundation Internship

This repository contains the tasks I completed during my internship at [The Sparks Foundation](https://www.thesparksfoundationsingapore.org/).

## Internship Details

- **Internship Category:** Data Science and Business Analytics
- **Internship Duration:** 1 Month (July 2024)
- **Internship Type:** Work from Home

## Task 1: Prediction using Supervised ML (Level - Beginner)

This task involves predicting the percentage of marks a student is expected to achieve based on the number of hours they study. The objective is to implement a simple linear regression model.

### Objectives

1. Predict the percentage of marks of a student based on the number of study hours.
2. Implement a simple linear regression model to solve the problem.
3. Use the model to predict the score if a student studies for 9.25 hours a day.

### Tools Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

### Results

- Developed a linear regression model to predict student scores.
- Predicted the score for a student studying 9.25 hours a day was approximately [insert predicted score here].

## How to Run the Code

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the code.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook `Task-1_Linear_Regression.ipynb`.
4. Run the notebook to see the results and predictions.

## Conclusion

Through this task, I gained hands-on experience in building and evaluating simple linear regression models. This foundational task helped enhance my understanding of supervised machine learning techniques.
